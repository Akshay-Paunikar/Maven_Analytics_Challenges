    "<h3>Challenge Objective:</h3>\n",
    "For the Maven Rewards Challenge, youâ€™ll play the role of a Sr. Marketing Analyst at Maven Cafe.\n",
    "\n",
    "You've just run a test by sending different combinations of promotional offers to existing rewards members. Now that the 30-day period for the test has concluded, your task is to identify key customer segments and develop a data-driven strategy for future promotional messaging & targeting.\n",
    "\n",
    "The results need to be summarized in a report that will be presented to the CMO.\n",
    "\n",
    "<h3>Cafe Rewards Offers:</h3>\n",
    "Data that simulates the behavior of Cafe Rewards members over a 30-day period, including their transactions and responses to promotional offers.\n",
    "\n",
    "Customers receive offers once every few days and have a limited time to redeem them. These can be informational offers (simple advertisement of a product), discount offers, or \"buy one, get one\" (BOGO) offers. Each customer receives a different mix of offers, attempting to maximize their probability of making a purchase.\n",
    "\n",
    "Every customer purchase during the period is marked as a transaction. For a transaction to be attributed to an offer, it must occur at the same time as when the offer was \"completed\" by the customer."
