<h2>Maven Rewards Challenge:</h2>
Identify key Cafe Rewards customer segments and define offers that should used to target them effectively.

<h3>Challenge Objective:</h3>
For the Maven Rewards Challenge, youâ€™ll play the role of a Sr. Marketing Analyst at Maven Cafe.

You've just run a test by sending different combinations of promotional offers to existing rewards members. Now that the 30-day period for the test has concluded, your task is to identify key customer segments and develop a data-driven strategy for future promotional messaging & targeting. 

The results need to be summarized in a report that will be presented to the CMO.

<h3>Cafe Rewards Offers:</h3>
Data that simulates the behavior of Cafe Rewards members over a 30-day period, including their transactions and responses to promotional offers.

Customers receive offers once every few days and have a limited time to redeem them. These can be informational offers (simple advertisement of a product), discount offers, or "buy one, get one" (BOGO) offers. Each customer receives a different mix of offers, attempting to maximize their probability of making a purchase.

Every customer purchase during the period is marked as a transaction. For a transaction to be attributed to an offer, it must occur at the same time as when the offer was "completed" by the customer.

<h3>Maven Rewards Challenge:</h3>
