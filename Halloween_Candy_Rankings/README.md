<h2>Maven Halloween Candy Rankings Challenge</h2>

Use data to find the 3 types of Halloween candy that will make you the most popular house on the block.

In 2017, Walt Hickey from FiveThirthyEight set out to find the Halloween candy most people prefer. To figure it out, he set up an experiment in which online voters could select their favorite candy from randomly generated matchups (for example, Twix or Snickers?).

After compiling about 269,000 votes from 8,371 different IP addresses, Walt calculated the win percentage for each type of candy and included several key attributes (for example, does it contain chocolate?) to find what makes them popular.
